### Interacting With Smartcontracts

In order to call a function only using the date field of call, 
we need to encode the functioin name, the parameters we want to add down to binary level

To encode function name, we need to grab the function selector.
The 'function selector' is the first 4 bytes of the 'function signature'. 
'Function signature' is the string which defines  a function names of a parameter.

Examples:
Function signature: ```transfer(address, uint256)``` 
The function name is 'transfer', it takes an address and a uint256 as it's inputs.
If we encode the 'transfer' function and take the first four bytes of it we get the function selector '0xa9059cbb'.

Function selector: 0xa9059cbb
This is how Solidity knows the 'transfer' functioin needs to be called.

# Get function selector for 'transfer' function 
```function getSelectorOne() public pure returns(bytes4 selector){
   selector = bytes4(keccak256(bytes("transfer(address, uint256)")));
   return selector;
}```

returns 0xa9059cbb

# Transfer function 
```function transfer(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public {
        s_someAddress = someAddress;
        s_amount = amount;
        }```

When we directly call 'transfer', we want it to grab the function selector and do some other stuff

We also need the parameters we want to add.

# Encode paramaters with function selector
We use ```abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4 selector, args)``` 
We will stick our selector onto the data that we give it (as args)

This is going to give us all the data that we need to put in the DATA field of the transaction to send to the contract, and the contract uses 'transfer' function, passes in the address and the amount.

```function getDataToCallTransfer(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public pure returns(bytes memory){
    return abi.encodeWithSelector(getSelectorOne(), someAddress, amount );
    }```
Returns:
0x543f08910000000000000000000000005e17b14add6c386305a32928f985b29bba34eff50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000309 

We put the returned bytes in the data field of the transaction to call 'transfer' from anywhere.

Now we can call the 'transfer' function without having to call it.
We can directly call 'transfer' function by passing the parameters without calling ```contract.transfer()```

```function calTransferFunctionDirectly(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public returns(bytes4, bool){
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) =address(this).call(
            // getDataToCallTransfer(someAddress, amount));
            abi.encodeWithSelector(getSelectorOne(), someAddress, amount);
            return (bytes4(returnData), success);
    }```

Successfully calls 'transfer' function and updates the values of s_someAddress and s_amount to entered value.

We can call the function using ```abi.encodeWithSignature()``` to get the same result 
```function Signature_callTransferFunctionDirectly(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public returns(bytes4, bool success){
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = address(this).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("transfer(address,uint256)", someAddress, amount));
        return (bytes4(returnData), success);
        }```

CallAnything.sol
```pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

contract CallAnything {

    // Storage variables
    address public s_someAddress;
    uint256 public s_amount;

    function transfer(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public {
        s_someAddress = someAddress;
        s_amount = amount;
    }

    function getSelectorOne() public pure returns(bytes4 selector){
        return bytes4(keccak256("transfer(address,uint256)"));
    } 

    function getDataToCallTransfer(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public pure returns(bytes memory){
        return abi.encodeWithSelector(getSelectorOne(), someAddress, amount);
    }

    function callTransferFunctionDirectly(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public returns(bytes4, bool success){
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = address(this).call(abi.encodeWithSelector(getSelectorOne(), someAddress, amount));
        return (bytes4(returnData), success);
    }

    function Signature_callTransferFunctionDirectly(address someAddress, uint256 amount) public returns(bytes4, bool success){
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = address(this).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("transfer(address,uint256)", someAddress, amount));
        return (bytes4(returnData), success);
    }

}```

Similarly, we can also call functions of a contract from another contract.
